# Mini Project
This project is a web application that predicts whether a child has dyslexia based on a survey filled by parents and a quiz taken by the child. The system uses a machine learning model to make predictions and stores the data in a MongoDB database. It is built using Flask for the backend, Python for the model, and MongoDB for data storage. The project helps identify dyslexia severity based on survey responses and quiz performance.
